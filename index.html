  <p>Making sense of digital rights</p>

  <p>What: To give control to individuals of their rights to online <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>data protection</strong> and <strong>free speech</strong> through research, education, advocacy and the provision of information and advice.</p>

  <p>Why: <strong>Trust</strong> is an essential commodity in any well-functioning democratic system. We believe that the web should be democratic; it should serve us all equally. But trust is in short supply. We want to help solve this, and we think that the way to do it is through increased clarity and visibility of the <strong>rights</strong> <strong>and responsibilities</strong> of all users of the web. We want citizens to feel in control of their digital destinies.</p>

  <p>How: Our <em>first project</em> involves taking the <strong>Terms of Service</strong> of the most frequently encountered companies on the web, making them transparent and understandable, and showing how those terms of service impact upon usersâ€™ human rights.</p>

  <p>Our <em>second project</em> will bring together a suite of the best <strong>digital self-defence</strong> tools and practices in an easy to implement package so that people can take more control of their digital identity.</p>

  <p>Who: <strong>Jonathan Price</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Nicolo Zingales</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Pernille Tranberg</strong></p>

  <p>When: Our first project will roll out in November 2015.</p>
