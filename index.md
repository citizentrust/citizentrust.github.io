============

Making sense of digital rights

What: To give control to individuals of their rights to online
**privacy**, **data protection** and **free speech** through research,
education, advocacy and the provision of information and advice.

Why: **Trust** is an essential commodity in any well-functioning
democratic system. We believe that the web should be democratic; it
should serve us all equally. But trust is in short supply. We want to
help solve this, and we think that the way to do it is through increased
clarity and visibility of the **rights** **and responsibilities** of all
users of the web. We want citizens to feel in control of their digital
destinies.

How: Our *first project* involves taking the **Terms of Service** of the
most frequently encountered companies on the web, making them
transparent and understandable, and showing how those terms of service
impact upon usersâ€™ human rights.

Our *second project* will bring together a suite of the best **digital
self-defence** tools and practices in an easy to implement package so
that people can take more control of their digital identity.

Who: **Jonathan Price**

**Nicolo Zingales**

**Pernille Tranberg**

When: Our first project will roll out in November 2015.
